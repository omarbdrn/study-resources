# Study Resources

Well i started this repo as some kind of "motivation" for myself while studying, but shit is hard and takes a lot of time therefore here's the resources i use and what i do on daily basis for anyone who's interested to go over the same shitty road i went/going through.

*(i also recommend taking notes of the stuff you find interesting in any of the resources below and mind mapping whenever you learn new stuff. do this if you're a dumbass like me with a short-term memory)*

## Development

In this part i've some stuff aligned for testing out my capabilities in programming and new resources to study from. (Personally i like reading books and testing out on different platforms to grasp the different ideas that exist in the field) 

**Digital Design**:
- The Fields of Electronics by Ralph Morrison and (Electrical Engineering 101: Everything you should've learned in school by Darren Ashby)  
- Digital Design and Computer Architecture by David M. Harris (Hardware mainly and finishes off with some MIPS Assembly) 
- Computer Organization And Design by David A. Patterson

**OS Internals**:
- [The Design of the UNIX OS](https://www.amazon.com/Design-UNIX-Operating-System/dp/0132017997)
- [Linux Kernel Development](https://www.doc-developpement-durable.org/file/Projets-informatiques/cours-&-manuels-informatiques/Linux/Linux%20Kernel%20Development,%203rd%20Edition.pdf)
- [Algorithmica](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc/)
- Operating Systems, Internals and Design Principles 7th Edition.
- UNIX and Linux System Adminstration Handbook by Evi Nemeth

**ML**:
- NLTK in python
- NNFS by sentdex
- Generative Deep Learning by David Foster

**Programming**:
- The Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt *(This book is mainly tips and scenarios that you encounter on daily basis, i love it tbh)*
- The C++ Programming Language by STROUSTRUP 4th Edition *(This book is written by the creator of cpp so it's HEAVY and large, if you're not aiming to be proficient in cpp just choose a topic from the TOC and read it)*
- Concepts in Programming Languages by John C. Mitchell *(It's heavy with "read for culture" sections, just read through it whenever you have time)*
- [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009ZUZ9FW) *(I chose Learn C The Hard Way by ZED over this)*
- [The Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.9/) *i don't read books for python*.
- ProgrammingGroundUp by Jonathan Bartlett *(didn't like it at all but give it a try)*
- System Design Books by Alex Xu
- Software Architecture in Practice by Len Bass
- Database Internals By Alex Petrov

**Networking**:
- CCNA, CCNP, OSWP, etc guides
- Check for simulations and build your own lab
- Tons of books and websites for this topic tbh just have fun breaking your shit while testing the stuff you learn and building your own lab it's more fun :)
- Design your own Network Protocol *(A challenge or a book i don't remember what it was but try searching it up and doing it anyways)*
- Read the RFC for dead protocols too.


**Problem Solving**:
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) *(You already know it)*
- LLM Generated questions *(Well we've AI now so better use it in a way that's helpful for you, Feed it a dataset of some of the challenges you like and it'll generate you some new stuff)*
- [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io/)
- [Build Your Own](https://build-your-own.org/)
- [CP-Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) *(I use this to understand the more uncommon algorithms that exist and by uncommon i mean the stuff that's not in Uni nor in the majority of DSA books)*
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- GetCracked by Coding Jesus *(It's still in alpha version, but the questions are good for testing out your scattered knowledge and to assess yourself with some fun brainteasers)*
- Data Structures and Algorithmic Puzzles by Narasimha Karumanchi
- The Algorithm Design Manual

## STEM Material

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
- [MathHelp](https://www.mathhelp.com/)
- [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/)
- [Pauls Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/)
- [CalcWorkship](https://calcworkshop.com/)
- [BYJU's](https://byjus.com/)
- [Probability & Statistics](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/)
- Dork your way into leaked PDFs from other Unis and check the MIT OCW ðŸ˜…

**Topics**:
You've got Operations Research (Game Theory), Probability and Statistics, Linear Algebra, Discrete math, Graph Theory, all of the shit you take in uni just dive in more deep with some more contextual applications.
I've tons of platforms that has puzzles and teaches these topics but i can't list them all off the top of my head so just search for the topics and it's practical usage then dive in deep if you're interested.

## Stuff i'm interested in

This section is mainly stuff i like trying out, if you're lost in life maybe give them a try

- Blender and C4D on YT
- OpenGL Programming Guide 8th edition
- Game Dev in Unity and simulations with OpenGL
- Studying ThreeJS with a friend
- Other random shit i like idk.
- Cryptography
- Cloud Infrastructure (DevOps, Security, IaC as kube, terraform, tons of other shit just search and you'll find the stuff you want)
- Data Engineering

*I use the books below as reference when i'm playing around with simulations*
- Physics by Serway *(I used this in high school, it didn't help but i learned some good stuff lol)*
- Engineering Mechanics *(fucking beautiful)*
- Vector Mechanics: Statics and Dynamics 9th Edition
- Tons of Security content, reports from security firms, leaks, RSS feeds just stuff to keep me up to date with the security industry.

- Design your first PCB and create your first product maybe, had fun with it and learned alot so give it a try, just fuck around and find out.
